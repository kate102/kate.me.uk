# kate.me.uk

Goal
The purpose of this project, is two fold. Firstly it is to create an app that can be used as a respository for my CV and for more informal information, but also as a vehicle for me to learn to create a React app.

Help & Inspiration

The initial app will be broadly based on the content of an Udemy course 
The Complete React Developer Course (with hooks and Redux) 
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/learn/lecture/7707614


Execution
To run my litte app locally I need to run ```live-server public``` from the kate.me.uk directory.
