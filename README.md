# kate.me.uk

Goal
The purpose of this project, is two fold. Firstly it is to create an app that can be used as a respository for my CV and for more informal information, but also as a vehicle for me to learn to create a React app.

Help & Inspiration

The initial app will be broadly based on the content of an Udemy course 
The Complete React Developer Course (with hooks and Redux) 
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/learn/lecture/7707614


Execution
To run my litte app locally I need to run ```live-server public``` from the kate.me.uk directory.

Set Up
npm install -g yarn
yarn global add live-server
npm init
npm install react react-dom
yarn global add babel-cli@6.24.1
yarn add babel-preset-react@6.24.1 babel-preset-env@1.5.2
babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch

Strategy
Complete as much of the course at lunchtimes at work
Recreate all of the modules covered at the weekend on my own app
